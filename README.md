Dear Reviewer,

Thanks a lot for your time to review our submission. Unfortunately, due to some technical issues with eval.ai, our submission is not being evaluated at nuScenes prediction challenge on eval.ai. We are currently in contact with eval.ai to resolve this issue.

The prediction.json file contains the LMFormer predictions corresponding to Table 1 in the paper. It can be directly uploaded to eval.ai (nuScenes Prediction Challenge) to get the metrics results, which are provided in the metric_reults.json file.

Thank you
